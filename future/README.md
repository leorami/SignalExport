# Future roadmap

This directory collects notes and stubs for potential future enhancements:

- Message searching and filtering
- Dynamic retrieval (on-demand) instead of single static HTML
- Rich reply threading: show quoted/replied message above bubbles
- Live sync with the current Signal Desktop DB
- Schema compatibility shims for prior Signal versions
- Contact info display (names, avatars, phone numbers, service IDs)
- Web UI framework exploration (React/Vite or minimal Vanilla JS)
- Packaging: pre-commit hooks, ruff/black, CI via GitHub Actions

These are intentionally out of scope for the initial refactor but help guide
incremental improvements without disrupting working exports.
